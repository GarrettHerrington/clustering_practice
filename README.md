This is a machine learning project that I did in jupyter notebook to build my understanding of clustering algorithms
Libraries I used included:
SKlearn
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scipy

I created different graphs useful to building clustering algorithms affectively such as dendrograms and cluster maps.

This project has helped me gain and understanding of clustering that's allowed me to dive deeper into clustering in other projects. 
I used "Datamining for Business Analytics" for the project and my next book I've been working on is the trusty "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow", which is a much deeper dive into cluster analysis!
